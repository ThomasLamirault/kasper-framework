DDD: Domains
============

Kasper domains can be understood as the DDD bounded contexts

.. topic:: Wikipedia - Bounded context

    Multiple models are in play on any large project. Yet when code based on distinct models is combined, software
    becomes buggy, unreliable, and difficult to understand. Communication among team members becomes confusing. It
    is often unclear in what context a model should not be applied.
    Therefore: Explicitly define the context within which a model applies. Explicitly set boundaries in terms of
    team organization, usage within specific parts of the application, and physical manifestations such as code
    bases and database schemas. Keep the model strictly consistent within these bounds, but donâ€™t be distracted
    or confused by issues outside.

A domain is separated into several logical parts, dependencies are symbolized here as arrows :

So a domain :

* is split between the **COMMAND** and **QUERY** areas
* offers an API composed of :
    * the commands it can handle
    * the queries it can answer
    * the events it will emit
* cannot have access to any other part of another domain than its api components (C/Q/E)
* represent an atomic functional area, generally handled by only one close team
